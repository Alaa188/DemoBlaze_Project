## Purpose

This project demonstrates **manual testing best practices**, **requirement traceability**, and **defect management**, while connecting test artifacts with **Agile workflows in Jira**. It also shows how ISTQB-FL and Agile testing principles can be applied to a demo project.

## Notes

- All test cases were executed successfully on the **DemoBlaze** website.
- Critical UI/UX bugs were discovered during exploratory testing.
- CSV files are ready for Jira import to maintain traceability between stories, test cases, and defects.
